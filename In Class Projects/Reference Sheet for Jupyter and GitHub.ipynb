Or you can enter *cd path_name*, meaning the full address of the folder starting with the drive that holds the folder. *cd ..* moves you up to the next highest folder in the directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "To reiterate the main points, before you start your first project, make sure that you have created an account on [GitHub](https://github.com). Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your system. After you've done these, follow the instruction in this video to see how to connect the Git software on your computer to your own account.\n",

    "\n",
    "> *git pull*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created your own repository, create a folder called *In Class Projects* where you will save your inclass work. I will grade thes *.ipynb* files. Also create a folder called *Homework Projects*. You will save the homework for each week in this folder. Once you have downloaded the repository to your computer usingj the *clone* command, you can save your projects in the repository folder on your computer. Once saved, you can upload your work from the main folder using the command line. After navigating to the main folder, enter the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *git add .*\n",
