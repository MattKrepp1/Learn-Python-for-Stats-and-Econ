    "Often we are performing statistical operations over a large dataset. It can be difficult to understand the meaning conveyed by these measures. Learning to program presents an opportunity to better understand how functions work. In this chapter we will create some basic statistical functions and compare their output to the functions built into python. By creating the function, you will understand the meaning of summation signs. Computing these statistics by hand would be a laborious process and expensive in terms of time. Once a function is constructed, it can be employed to calculate statistics in a fraction of the time.\n",

If a tail is fat, there exists a greater number of observations whose values are relatively far from the mean than is predicted by a normal distribution. Skewness may sometimes be thought of as the direction which a distribution leans. This can be due to the existence of asymmetric fat tails, long tails, or both. For example, if a distribution includes a long tail on the right side, but is normal otherwise, it is said to have a positive skew. The same can be said of a distribution with a fat right tail. Skewness can be ambiguous concerning the shape of the distribution. If a distribution has a fat right tail and a long left tail that is not fat, it is possible that its skewness will be zero, even though the shape of the distribution is asymmetric."
