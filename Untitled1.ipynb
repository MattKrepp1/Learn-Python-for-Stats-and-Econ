    "So far, we have dealt only with functions. Functions are convenient because they generalize some exercise given a certain type of input. In the last chapter we created a function that takes the mean value of a list of elements. It may be useful to create a function that is not owned by a class if you are in a hurry, but it is better to develop a habit of building class objects whenever you think you might want to reuse the functions that we have made. To take advantage of a function while scripting in a different file, we can import the file and instantiate a class object that owns these functions. When a function is owned by a class, we refer to this as a method. In this chapter, you will learn how to create a class with methods.\n",

It will include the functions \"add\", \"multiply\", and \"power\". Before we make any methods, however, we must initialize the class as an object itself.\n",
